<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About
-----
soloDev.Studio.xyz is a one man operation... Basically I'm just running a website that: 

* Displays the software I've created using DroidScript.
* Provides code and binary downloads
* Promote my future project idea (gitDroid)
* Beg people for money (donations)
* Do the occasional paid project. Either an Androiod app or Website
* Provide my own Highly PERMISSIVE software license (WTFSD)
* and of course, lay out my own ideas on FOSS ethics (While using Linux of course)

## Built Using DroidScript: (and Essential Studio)
-----
DroidScript is an awesome IDE on Android. But it is NOT free, nor Open Source. It vhas recently taken on a Saas model that I'm not a fan of at all..

Of course it is being done by a single guy, and it's an awesome IDE that allows you to code a full fledged applications using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and NodeJS.  Then compile your projects into a native Android Applications! I just wish he would have provided a crippled version for free, a Pro version for around $25 or $30. Then provide an optional subscription service for professional support and about 5 GB of cloud storage.


You can find it in the Google Play Store for free...

## Essential Studio
-----

I just submited an application for a free liccense to a greate looking WYSIWYG IDE by Syncfusion designed use AngularJS, Angular, Bootstrap and VUE2 components as well as several backend frameworks that I can't remember at the moment. I certainlu have fewer than 5 employees and I *think* I made less than five millionm last year. So I'.m fairly certain with my chances.
